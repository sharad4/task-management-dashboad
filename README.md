# React 19 Task Management Dashboard

A comprehensive task management application built with **React 19** and **Vite**, demonstrating all modern React concepts and patterns in a single project.

## 🚀 Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by status, priority, and search terms
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple tasks and update them simultaneously  
- **Real-time Analytics**: Lazy-loaded dashboard with task statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced search, memoization, and concurrent features

## 🎯 React 19 Concepts Demonstrated

### Core Hooks & State Management
- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`
- `useContext` for global state
- Custom hooks (`useDebounce`, `useTaskManager`)

### React 19 Specific Features
- `use()` hook patterns
- `useTransition` & `useDeferredValue`
- `startTransition` for priority updates
- Concurrent rendering with Suspense

### Advanced Patterns
- Error Boundaries
- Lazy loading with `React.lazy()`
- `memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` optimization
- `forwardRef` and `useId` for accessibility
- Portal patterns for modals
